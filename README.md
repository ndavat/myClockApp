**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using React Native, TypeScript, and Expo**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Changes

This project has been migrated to use Expo Application Services (EAS) for builds, which replaces the previous native Android and iOS build configurations. The native Android and iOS files have been removed as part of this migration.

Additionally, several core files have been updated to modernize the codebase and improve functionality.
