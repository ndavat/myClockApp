- Exact alarm scheduling for precise timing

## üîß Configuration

### Notification Channels
The app creates dedicated notification channels for:
- **Alarm notifications** - High priority with sound and vibration
- **Timer notifications** - High priority with sound and vibration

### Permissions
Required Android permissions are automatically configured:
- `VIBRATE` - For alarm/timer vibration
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - To restore alarms after reboot
- `WAKE_LOCK` - To keep alarms active in background
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` - For precise alarm timing
